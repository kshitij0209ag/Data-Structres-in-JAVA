# Definition :- DS describes you, how to store the data in memry so that computer can perform operations 
on data efficiently.

# Types of operations:-
insert
delete
display
update


# How to measure efficiencey:-
1. Time Complexity:- it means how much time is taken to perform the operation into them.
2. Space Complexity:- it means that how much memory will take it into the data.

# How many data structures are there:-
1. Array:- When it saves the data it gives the contiguous memory allocation and it saves the same 
type of data.

2. linkedlist:- It doesn't save contiguous memory allocation. It is a type of linear data structre, 
and the linked list are linked using pointers

3. stack:- Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are 
performed. It follows the Last in First Out rule(LIFO) 

4. Queue:- A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are 
performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO)

5. tree:- 
6. graph 
7. hashing
