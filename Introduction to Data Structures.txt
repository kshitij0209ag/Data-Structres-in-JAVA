Definition :- DS describes you, how to store the data in memry so that computer can perform operations 
on data efficiently.

types of operations:-
insert
delete
display
update


how to measure efficiencey:-
time complexity:- it means how much time is taken to perform the operation into them.
space complexity:- it means that how much memory will take it into the data.

How many data structures are there:-
1. Array:- When it saves the data it gives the contiguous memory allocation and it saves the same 
type of data.
2. linkedlist:- It doesn't save contiguous memory allocation. It is a type of linear data structre, 
and the linked list are linked using pointers
3. stack:- Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are 
performed. It follows the Last in First Out rule(LIFO) 
4. queue:- 
5. tree 
6. graph 
7. hashing
