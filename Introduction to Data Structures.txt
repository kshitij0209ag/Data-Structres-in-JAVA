# Definition :- DS describes you, how to store the data in memry so that computer can perform operations 
on data efficiently.

# Types of operations:-
insert
delete
display
update


# How to measure efficiencey:-
1. Time Complexity:- it means how much time is taken to perform the operation into them.
2. Space Complexity:- it means that how much memory will take it into the data.

# How many data structures are there:-
1. Array:- When it saves the data it gives the contiguous memory allocation and it saves the same 
type of data.

2. linkedlist:- It doesn't save contiguous memory allocation. It is a type of linear data structre, 
and the linked list are linked using pointers

3. stack:- Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are 
performed. It follows the Last in First Out rule(LIFO) 

4. Queue:- A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are 
performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO)

5. Tree:- It means that elements have atmost 2 childrens that we call in the form of left and right.

6. Graph:- It is a type non-liner data structure which consist of nodes and edges, where nodes can be 
called as the vertices and edges are the lines that conect two nodes each other in graph. edges are called to be 
lines or arcs.

7. Hashing:- it means we can use like, if we have a large amount of data then we can can store into a table, 
just like an array.
